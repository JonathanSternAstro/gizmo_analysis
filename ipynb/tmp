We use the FIRE cosmological simulations to study how cosmological accretion fuels thin-disk star formation in $z\sim 0$, Milky-Way-mass galaxies. In central galaxies with a high fraction ($>70\%$) of stars in a thin disk we find that:
(i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing gas mass on halo scales ($\gtrsim 20$ kpc), with the accretion rate regulated by radiative losses;
(ii) this hot accretion cools to $\lesssim10^4\,{\rm K}$ at the galaxy-halo interface, with the peak of the cooling located just outside the galaxy;
(iii) concurrent with cooling the accreting gas \textit{circularizes}, i.e.\ the accretion flow transitions from a hot quasi-spherical configuration to a cool disk-like configuration. We demonstrate that the radius of circularization+cooling is determined by the net angular momentum of the hot accreting gas.
Using a sample of \Nsample~galaxies spanning a halo mass range of $10^{10.5} M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm h} \lesssim 10^{12} M_\odot$, we show that the dominance of this accretion mode is tightly correlated with the fraction of thin disk stars in the central galaxy. Specifically, central galaxies with a thick disk / irregular morphology do not accrete via this mode, but rather the accreted gas cools far beyond the galaxy edge and reaches the galaxy as cold accretion. Our results suggest that hot accretion is a fundamental building block of thin star forming disks.
